                    3 Web Development Jobs
                </div>
                <p>I looked at three web development jobs. One for ionCube, one for the University of Edinburgh and one for Much Better Adventures. The ionCube one seems to be heavily <a href="glossary.html">JavaScript</a> reliant as they emphasise the importance of being able to use a lot of <a href="glossary.html">JavaScript</a> functions and the general importance of having a good grasp of Object Oriented Programming. As with most Web Development jobs they require good skills in <a href="glossary.html">HTML</a> and <a href="glossary.html">CSS</a> and a good sense of modern design techniques. They also mention <a href="glossary.html">PHP</a>, Linux skills and database skills as being recommended to have. Finally, being able to work confidently in small groups or on your own is a vital skill. This is a job posting for their new project, ionCube24. 
                        <br><br>The University of Edinburgh job is instead a two-year general post. This is reflected in the skills that they require – this posting doesn’t appear to have a skill preference and just asks for general skills in <a href="glossary.html">HTML</a>, <a href="glossary.html">CSS</a>, <a href="glossary.html">PHP</a>, <a href="glossary.html">JavaScript</a>, jQuery and Bootstrap. This job doesn’t ask for group work skills and instead just states that you must be able to work independently and confidently. As this is a more long-term position you are also required to, not only create new content but to, be able to maintain the old web based content. Finally, as this is at a university, being willing and able to work with students is vital.
                        <br><br>The final job for Much Better Adventures is a listing looking for front-end developers. They are also looking for a high level of ability in all aspects of <a href="glossary.html">JavaScript</a> and jQuery as well as general skills in <a href="glossary.html">HTML</a> and <a href="glossary.html">CSS</a>. They are also looking for Python skills (specifically for use with Django). They are also quite eager for you to be able to use GIT to a decent level. The fact that this is a front-end developer place means that you will be expected to be able to produce a decent user interface with lots of fancy animations that add to the user experience.
