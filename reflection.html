                <p>This website has been the final product of my first 
                    term of web development. I had a little experience 
                    of it from Highschool however nothing I produced back 
                    then was up to the standards of this.<br><br>I’m, overall, 
                    quite happy with how its turned out and I would only make 
                    a few criticisms. I think the main one would be the glossary 
                    page. While I am very happy with how it turned out, it wasn’t 
                    the best idea when it came to switching over to mobile. I 
                    had to completely re-design the UI which, although not a 
                    problem, was a bit time consuming. I also would probably 
                    try and change how I laid out some of the forms. They are a 
                    bit clunky at times and some of them require labels to indicate 
                    what buttons do. I feel with a better UI design I could have 
                    avoided that.<br><br>As far as learning was concerned, I found 
                    the classes invaluable however, I found that I learnt the most 
                    during the process of creating the website. I don’t know if I always 
                    followed the best practice or not but I certainly learnt ways of doing 
                    things that I wouldn’t know otherwise.<br><br>Working in a team was 
                    also a good experience as it meant that whenever I got stuck or 
                    wanted advice on an aspect of the design, I could just message the 
                    WhatsApp chat and get advice.<br><br>The glossary I found a list 
                    of terms online however I couldn’t find a decent way to do 
                    the referencing, so I changed the list and then used definitions 
                    that I learnt from when I did computer science at school. <br><br>
                    I have attached to this page 3 sketches I did to design various 
                    parts of the website. These are also shown on the good practice page. 
                    Sketches are something that I find very useful as it gives 
                    me a visual goal to work towards while focusing on the 
                    actual code. <br><br>Finally, I’ve attached the evidence 
                    of validating each webpage.</p>
